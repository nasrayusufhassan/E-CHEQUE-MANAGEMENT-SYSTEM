This program is a console-based E-Cheque Management System written in C that allows users to create an account, log in using an email and password, write electronic cheques and send them to a another person, and view sent or pending cheque statements. A cheque is declared pending if the password entered during confirmation is incorrect. The system uses structures to store user and cheque information and file handling to save account details and transaction records in text files, enabling data to be stored and accessed even after the program is closed.
